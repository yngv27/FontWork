# FontWork
Font source files (either open source or "clean room" reproductions
Font generation tools (for converting to Espruino use)

Right now, there are two tools. 
- **bdf2bangle.html** converts an old school .bdf font to Espruino format.
- **MakeFont.html** converts a black on white image (png, gif, jpg) to Espruino format.

In both casees, the font is displayed in javascript code, suitable for copy/paste into
Espruino.
